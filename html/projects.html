        <h3>University Capstone Project</h3>
      </a>
      <p>Independent research project on the content of a dark web cyber blackhat forum.
        Data analysis with python and AI.
        <br>
        We were able to analyze over 9,000,000 forum posts to deeply understand the topics discussed by participants. 
        We isolated specific conversations to identify key contributors in the forum, 
        a development that can be used in to combat cyber attacks.
        <br>
        On our github you may find the .ipynb files that train the models. More data will be shared in May when we finalize our chosen models (too big to be shared on github).</p>

        <h3>Reinforcement Learning Project</h3>
      </a>
      <div>
      <p>Implemented a Reinforcement Learning algorithm called Q-Learning to optimize pathfinding on a virtual map of Queen's university campus using Python.
      We interacted with the Open Street Maps api through the overpassQuery language to extract transitions and distances.
      The project demonstrated an ability to apply Reinforcement Learning techniques to real-world problems and achieved improved pathfinding results compared to traditional search algorithms.

        <h3>Database Management Systems Restaurant Course Project</h3>
      </a>
    
      <p>
        Currently completing a Database Management Systems course where I develop a full-fledged restaurant web application from scratch. 
        I began with creating an entity-relationship diagram, followed by building the equivalent database using mySQL, 
        and finally implemented the frontend using PHP.

        <h3>Personal Website</h3>
      </a>
      <p>Developed and maintained a personal portfolio website that showcases technical skills and knowledge acquired in infrastructure, 
        highlighting work experiences, personal projects and a curated reading list. 
        The website is hosted on AWS, powered by NGINX on a Linux operating system and implemented with HTML and CSS. Implemented standard security including HTTP/2 support, 
        secure SSL certificates, and forced HTTPS redirection to ensure security. <br>
      <!-- In the future, I will upgrade this website to be written in angular. -->
