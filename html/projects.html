        <h3>Reinforcement Learning Project</h3>
      </a>
      <div>
      <p>Implemented a Reinforcement Learning algorithm called Q-Learning to optimize pathfinding on a virtual map of Queen's university campus using Python.
      We interacted with the Open Street Maps api through the overpassQuery language to extract transitions and distances.
      The project demonstrated an ability to apply Reinforcement Learning techniques to real-world problems and achieved improved pathfinding results compared to traditional search algorithms.

        <h3>University Capstone Project</h3>
      </a>
      <p>Independent research project on the content of a dark web cyber blackhat forum. 
        Utilized BERTopic neural network to parse and analyze conversations, 
        resulting in a deeper understanding of the topics discussed by participants. 
        Attempted to isolate specific conversations for further analysis to aid in protecting against cyber attacks.</p>

        <h3>Database Managment Systems Resteraunt Course Project</h3>
      <p>
        Curently completing a Database Management Systems course where I develop a full-fledged restaurant web application from scratch. 
        I began with creating an entity-relationship diagram, followed by building the eqivalent database using mySQL, 
        and finally implemented the frontend using PHP.

        <h3>Personal Website</h3>
      </a>
      <p>Developed and maintained a personal portfolio website that showcases technical skills and knowledge acquired in infrastructure, 
        highlighting work experiences, personal projects and a curated reading list. 
        The website is hosted on AWS, powered by NGINX on a Linux operating system and implemented with HTML and CSS. Implemented industry standard features including HTTP/2 support, 
        secure SSL certificates, and forced HTTPS redirection to enhance user experience and security.</p>
