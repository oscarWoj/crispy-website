        <h3>Reinforcment Learning Project</h3>

      <p>Implemented a Reinforcement Learning algorithm called Q-Learning to optimize pathfinding on a virtual map of Queen's university campus using Python.
         Q-Learning is a Model-free RL algorithm, meaning it does not need a representation of the enviroment to find the optimal policy.
      We interacted with the Open Street Maps api through the overpassQuery language to extract transitions and distances.</p>
